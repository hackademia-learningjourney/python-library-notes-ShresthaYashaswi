1. Pandas:
Pandas is a free software that offers data structures and operations to manipulate numerical tables and time series. 
It is basically a software library written for the Python programming language.
It is helpful in filtering, sorting and calculating things with data.
Pros:
-provides fast, flexible and expressive data structures
Cons:
-inefficient(since it requires approx 5-10 times as much memory as the size of the data)
-it does not support parallel computing across different cores

2. NumPy:
NumPy is a free, open-source library for the Python programming language
It adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
It also has a big collection of high-level mathematics functions to opporate on these arrays.
It is mainly used for numerical data, scientific computing concepts and it has built in mathematical functions. 
Pros:
-it is beginner friendly and flexible
-it also integrates with other programming languages other than Python
- allows you to reduce memory usage and optimize code
-increases the mathematical functions that can be used
Cons:
-It does not provide as much flexible access to data as Pandas can
- It is better suited for homogenous data so it is not ideal for tranforming or altering data

3. Tensorflow:
Tensorflow is a free and open-source software library for AI and machine learning. 
It was developed by Google Brain team for use in research. 
It is used for developing machine learning applications and neural networks.
 
Pros:
-it can be used in many different programming languages such as Python, Javascript and C++
- it has a broad library of pre-trained models available for use in projects
- it has better data visulaization power
 Cons:
-does not have Windows support
- it is comparatively slow 

4. Keras
Keras is an open-source library that provides Python interface for artificial neural networks.
Keras is useful in faster creation of models and robust support for deployment and adoption.   
It is used for research and development within deep learing. It can also be used to create guides for developers and documentation thorughout a project.
Pros:
- it is simple and easy to use
-it provides many pre-trained models
Cons:
-the errors given by the Keras library are not effective
-gives you low-level errors many times
-does not support features of dynamic chart creation

5. Sklearn
Sklearn or scikit-learn is an open source library used for predictive data analysis. 
It is useful for statistical modeling and machine learning. 
It has effective tools such as regression, classification, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Pros:
-It is free and has less liscensing restrictions.
- A vast number of authors and online community contributes to it. 
-Easy to use.
Cons: 
-Relatively not as useful for in-depth learning.

6. Pytorch
It was developed by Facebook and it has an extensive library that can be used to build complete modules.
It has strong support for GPU acceleration.
It is used for deep learning and neural network.
Pros:
-it has a user-friendly design and structure
- has many pre-trained models
-has useful debugging tools
Cons: 
-since it is relatively new, it currently has less community support
- does not have interfaces for monitoring and visualization
